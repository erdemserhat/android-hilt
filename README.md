## Personal Learning Outcomes

In this project, I deepened my understanding of **Dependency Injection (DI)** by working with **Hilt** in an Android environment. This codelab provided me with practical experience in:

- **Implementing Dependency Injection with Hilt**: I learned how to set up and use Hilt to manage dependencies in an Android application, simplifying the process of providing dependencies where they are needed.
- **Benefits of Dependency Injection**: Through this project, I experienced the advantages of DI, including improved code reusability, easier refactoring, and more straightforward testing.
- **Integrating Hilt with Jetpack Components**: I explored how Hilt integrates seamlessly with other Jetpack components, making it a powerful tool for building well-architected Android apps.
